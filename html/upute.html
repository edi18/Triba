            <p>Game consists of a lattice grid. There are two players (player A and B) selecting three points in turns, 
                after selection a triangle is constructed from the three points. A triangle can be constructed only if 
                it does not intersect with any previously constructed triangles. The player that is unable to construct any more triangles loses.</p>
            <p>There are four avaliable maps: 8x6, 6x10, 8x8 and a triangle map.</p>
